# üì¢ Broadcasting Chat App (WebSocket)

This is a simple **real-time chat application** built using **React (frontend)** and **WebSocket (backend)**.  
Users can join a **room**, and any message sent by one user is **broadcasted to all members present in the same room**.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Join chat rooms.
- Real-time message broadcasting using WebSockets.
- Message display with auto-updates.
- Clean UI with Tailwind CSS.
- WebSocket connection cleanup on unmount.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, WebSocket (ws)  
- **Protocol:** WebSocket

# WebSockets

WebSockets provide **persistent, full-duplex communication** between a client and a server over a single TCP connection.  
Unlike HTTP (which is request/response-based), WebSockets enable real-time data transfer in both directions without re-establishing the connection.

---

## Key Points
- Protocol: **ws://** (or **wss://** for secure connections)
- Uses a **single TCP connection**
- Supports **event-driven communication**
- Commonly used for **chat apps, live notifications, multiplayer games**, etc.

## Polling vs Long Polling vs WebSockets

| Feature          | Polling                     | Long Polling                    | WebSockets                |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Connection      | Multiple HTTP requests    | HTTP request held until data    | Single persistent TCP     |
| Latency         | High                      | Medium                          | Very Low (real-time)      |
| Server Load     | High                      | Medium                          | Low                       |
| Best Use Case   | Rare updates              | Occasional updates              | Real-time apps            |
